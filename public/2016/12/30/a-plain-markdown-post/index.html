<h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>
<p>Machine learning (ML) is increasingly used in healthcare. Currently, its use in the field of infection management is still limited. We reviewed the use of ML in infection management research to support navigation in this multidisciplinary field.</p>
<h3 id="methods">Methods</h3>
<p>A Medline search using the keywords artificial intelligence, machine learning, infection*, and infectious disease* for the years 2014 to 2019 was conducted. Studies were included if routine data in an inpatient setting were used.</p>
<h3 id="results">Results</h3>
<p>Fifty-two studies were included and grouped by research area: detection/prediction of sepsis (n = 19), hospital-acquired infections (n =11), postoperative infections (n = 11), microbiological test results (n = 4), infections in general and musculoskeletal infections (each n = 2), and other areas (urinary tract infections, deep fungal infections, antimicrobial prescriptions; n = 1 each). The three best performing ML models, judged by area under the curve, used long short-term memory networks, L1-regularized logistic regression, and artificial neural networks. Overall, the studies were very heterogeneous in their approach and reporting, e.g. information on data handling and software code was often lacking. Validation on new datasets and/or in other institutions was rarely done. Clinical studies on the impact of ML in infection management were lacking.</p>
<h3 id="discussion">Discussion</h3>
<p>Promising approaches of ML use in infectious diseases were identified. But building trust in these new technologies will require improved reporting. Explainability and interpretability of the used models was rarely addressed and should be further explored. Independent model validation and clinical studies evaluating the added value of ML approaches are needed.</p>
